## Predict-Prices-of-a-Stock
  In this project, we developed advanced time series forecasting models to predict future stock prices using historical market data and trends. By incorporating techniques such as ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks), and Prophet, we aimed to enhance the accuracy and reliability of our predictions. These models analyze past stock price movements, seasonal patterns, and market volatility to generate forecasts that assist investors in making informed decisions. By providing precise and timely stock price predictions, this project supports strategic investment planning and risk management, ultimately contributing to more effective financial decision-making and portfolio management.
